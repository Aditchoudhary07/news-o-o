[SUSE](https://www.suse.com/), the main sponsor of the [openSUSE Project](https://get.opensuse.org/), is offering a discount on its eLearning platform for members looking to enhance their skills in SUSE technologies.

The eLearning offers a variety of training courses that could be useful to openSUSE users, including Linux administration, Kubernetes, security and systems management.

A couple members from the community reached out to [Tori Easterly](https://www.suse.com/c/author/teasterlysuse-com/) inquiring about the possibility for members to receive a discount or a more accessible pricing option for those interested in enhancing their skills. As a result, SUSE extended a 20 percent discount.

Enterprise-level training allows people to learn at their own pace and convenience. The courses cover Linux fundamentals, automation and cutting-edge technologies like Kubernetes and container management. The eLearning provides unlimited access to all SUSE IT courses, spanning Linux, Systems Management, Security, Edge Computing and more. As IT evolves rapidly, the curriculum is frequently updated to reflect the latest advancements in SUSE technologies. 

openSUSE Project members can get 20 percent off [SUSE eLearning](https://www.suse.com/shop/elearning/) courses using the Coupon Code **TRAIN2025** upon checkout.
