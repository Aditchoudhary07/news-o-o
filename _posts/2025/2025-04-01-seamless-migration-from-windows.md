[Windows 10 End of Life](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro) is approaching and Linux distributions show creativity to attract Windows 10 users.

openSUSE takes a step further by offering users a seamless migration tool for migration from Windows 10 and 11 to openSUSE [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/) and [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/).
The migration tool covers the migration of the NTFS filesystem to Btrfs, user data, Steam game library, and most of the common applications that coexist on both platforms.

Advanced users will appreciate the command line interface of the [opensuse-migration-tool](https://github.com/openSUSE/opensuse-migration-tool).

Users can choose to upgrade their Windows systems to either openSUSE [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/), or [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/).

After the migration is done and the system is rebooted users can enjoy the user-friendly interface of openSUSE Leap or Tumbleweed with their favorite apps and much more.

I hope you've enjoyed reading our 1st of April article that is not really that far from reality, which is just not as seamless as the article presents it ðŸ˜‰.

Get your new favorite Linux distribution at [get.opensuse.org](https://get.opensuse.org) before [Windows 10 End of Life](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro) and stay supported.
