Members of the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Election Committee have provided an [update regarding this year’s Board election](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/KDQ4BNJUOPZVOVZ4ARHKMMUNIUUYWLHR/). This election will fill three [board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) seats. All eligible openSUSE members are encouraged to participate in shaping the future of the project.

The nomination process, originally scheduled for completion in December, has been extended due to an insufficient number of candidates. The updated timeline aims to provide more opportunities for members to engage in the process.

### Revised Election Timeline

- **Jan. 3, 2025:** Extension for nominations and applications for Board candidacy; membership drive begins
- **Jan. 18, 2025:** Final candidate list announced; campaign begins; membership drive continues (new members can vote but not run)
- **Jan. 19, 2025:** Voting opens 
- **Feb. 2, 2025:** Voting closes 
- **Feb. 3, 2025:** Election results announced 

The three open seats are held by Douglas DeMaio, Neal Gompa, and Patrick Fitzgerald. [Board members](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) serve as guides for the community, handle key project functions, facilitate initiatives, organize meetings, and manage openSUSE domains and trademarks. They also uphold community standards, including overseeing complaints and ensuring compliance with the openSUSE Code of Conduct.

### How to Participate

Any openSUSE member can stand for election by sending an email to `project@lists.opensuse.org` and `election-officials@lists.opensuse.org`. Members can also nominate others by contacting the Election Committee, who will confirm the nominee's interest. 

### Eligibility Requirements

Per the [Election Rules](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_rules), only current members are eligible to run for board positions. New members joining during the membership drive can participate in voting but cannot stand as candidates.

The election is overseen by committee members Ish Sookun, Edwin Zakaria, and Ariez Vachha. Their responsibilities include finalizing the candidate list and ensuring a smooth election process.

Let’s work together to make this election a success and continue driving openSUSE forward into 2025!
