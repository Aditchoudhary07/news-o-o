[AI's latest escapade into software piracy](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/microsoft-copilot-actively-helping-users-123658903.html) has left Microsoft scrambling, but let's be honest; why even go through the hassle? If people are looking at not paying for an operating system, they don’t need to look far when alternatives like [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) exist? 

With Linux distributions like openSUSE, there are no activation codes, no shady workarounds, no costs; just a fully functional, open and freely available operating system so users don’t have to break the law to break free from Windows’ licensing fees.

**The Financial Benefits of Moving to Linux**

Millions of computer users face a financial decision as they prepare for the end support for Windows 10 in October 2025; upgrade their operating systems at a cost depending on the users location, purchase new hardware with an OS installed or explore alternatives. Or, as [Copilot seems to suggest]((https://www.yahoo.com/tech/microsoft-copilot-actively-helping-users-123658903.html) ), they could just ask an AI how to pirate Windows; because nothing says “secure computing” like taking legal advice from a chatbot.

For those feeling the pinch of rising costs due to stagflation, Linux distributions, particularly [openSUSE’s Leap and Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/), offer a compelling, cost-effective alternative.

With no licensing fees, extended hardware compatibility and an abundance of software applications, Linux operating systems provide a compelling solution to reduce expenses while maintaining productivity, security and extending hardware lifespans to reduce electronic waste. 

As part of our Upgrade to Freedom! campaign, this write-up focuses on the financial benefits of switching to openSUSE or another Linux operating system.

**No Licensing Fees**

One of the most immediate savings people notice when switching to Linux is the elimination of licensing fees. Licensing fees for some commercial operating systems [can cost more than $100 USD per device](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/windows-11-home/dg7gmgf0krt0). Enterprise solutions often incur additional costs for maintenance and upgrades.

Instead, people can save that money by going to [get.opensuse.org](https://get.opensuse.org/) and downloading an operating system without needing any codes or paying any money. 

This zero-cost licensing model translates to significant savings to individual users, small businesses and large enterprises. 

Investing in Linux is investing in one's knowledge; it’s an investment into freedom. People get a professional-grade operating system without recurring costs using openSUSE.

**Extend the Life of Your Hardware**

Newer versions of Windows may require specific hardware features like TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot. For many older devices, this could render these devices incompatible and force users to purchase new machines. 

The cost of a new laptop can run $350 USD or more, which is a substantial expense in a struggling economy. For a business, multiple devices could come at a hefty cost.

By contrast, openSUSE is optimized to run efficiently on a wide range of hardware, which includes older machines. [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/) provides long-term stability, while [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) offers the news software updates to ensure devices remain relevant and functional for years to come. Members of the openSUSE community can also recommend using distributions like [Slowroll](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Slowroll), [Aeon](https://aeondesktop.github.io/) and [Kalpa](https://kalpadesktop.org/).

By switching to Linux, users may extend the life of their existing hardware and avoid contributing to any unnecessary e-waste; a cost that is much more precious than financial savings.

**Apps and Open-Source Software**

The financial benefits of Linux extends well beyond the operating system itself. The distributions provide access to a vast library of free, open-source applications that can replace costly proprietary software.
  - Office Suites: LibreOffice is a powerful alternative to [office suites that charge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/buy/compare-all-microsoft-365-products) a premium.
  - Creative Tools: [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) provide robust alternatives to graphic design and image editing software, which can cost upwards of $600 per year for subscriptions.
  - Development Tools: Developers can access free Integrated Development Environments like [Visual Studio Code](https://flathub.org/apps/com.visualstudio.code), [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)’ IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition and [Eclipse](https://flathub.org/apps/org.eclipse.Java).

For users who require specific Windows applications, tools like [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), [Bottles](https://flathub.org/apps/com.usebottles.bottles) and [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) can help run those programs on Linux, which eliminates the need for additional software purchases.
Linux systems are renowned for stability and security along with the reduction of time and money spent on IT support and maintenance. 

Set up tools like [YaST](https://yast.opensuse.org/) and advances with [Agama](https://en.opensuse.org/Agama) provide intuitive ways to manage systems, updates, configurations and software installations, which can make it easy for non-technical users.

For businesses, the cost savings of switching to Linux can be immense. Companies running Windows often incur costs for server licenses and client access licenses (CALs). By moving to open-source solutions like openSUSE and its enterprise-focused sibling, [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/products/server/), businesses can significantly reduce their IT expenses.

Small and medium-sized businesses can save thousands of dollars annually by adopting Linux. It’s not just about the initial savings but an ongoing reduction to operational costs.

As Windows 10 nears its expiration date, users and businesses have a choice: switch to openSUSE for a free, reliable solution; or start asking AI for sketchy workarounds and hope for the best.

Here is a [step-by-step guide](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/11/26/transition-from-windows-step-by-step/) to start installing openSUSE.
