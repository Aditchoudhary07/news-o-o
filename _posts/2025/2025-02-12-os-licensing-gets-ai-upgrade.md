Developers of the [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) community continue their commitment toward improving legal compliance and software transparency with the release of the [ Cavil Legal Text dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openSUSE/cavil-legal-text) on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co). 

This dataset is designed to enhance automated legal text classification, which reduces manual review efforts and improves accuracy in identifying legal snippets within software projects.

"Open sourcing the dataset is cooler than just open sourcing the weights to a model fine-tuned by us because everyone can use it to make their own versions based on whatever open weight model they want," said Sebastian Riedel, one of the developers behind the project. 

The Cavil Legal Text dataset supports [Cavil](https://github.com/openSUSE/cavil/), which is a system built to automate the extraction and classification of potential legal texts in software packages. By leveraging AI, Cavil minimizes false positives when detecting license information, copyright statements and compliance-related content; this ensures that legal experts can focus on critical cases rather than sorting through large amounts of irrelevant data.

With 150,000 labeled samples, the dataset is instrumental in training AI models to distinguish between legal and non-legal text with a high degree of accuracy. It enables legal review workflows by improving text classifications, pattern matching and reduces the dependency of human intervention.

Cavil consists of three key parts: a user-friendly web application with a REST API, a job queue for handling background tasks like pattern matching and analysis, and an AI-powered text classification server that continually improves its ability to recognize legal texts. All these components interact seamlessly through PostgreSQL and HTTP; this allows human experts and lawyers to efficiently validate software licenses at scale.

Currently, Cavil employs a Character-level Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in production due to its efficiency and compatibility with existing infrastructure. However, an alternative approach using fine-tuned Llama-3 models is under exploration. The [Llama-Lawyer Experiment](https://github.com/kraih/llama-lawyer) suggests that large language models like Llama-3-8B-Instruct could provide more adaptable and context-aware classification with less frequent retraining.

The dataset is licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later and is freely available on Hugging Face for researchers, developers, and compliance teams to explore and contribute. Open-source contributors can refine AI classification models, propose new legal text patterns, and support the ongoing improvement of automated legal compliance in software projects.

Those interested can explore the dataset on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openSUSE/cavil-legal-text), read the Cavil documentation, experiment with Llama-3 through the [Llama-Lawyer repository](https://github.com/kraih/llama-lawyer), and contribute to [openSUSEâ€™s compliance efforts through GitHub](https://github.com/openSUSE/cavil/).
