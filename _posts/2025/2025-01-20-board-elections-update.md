Members of the [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Election Committee have informed the project that [Board elections](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) are underway.

[Four candidates](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/IQATUNHX4J4Z5ULCPYSW2TNXDCONV2M4/) are running for three open seats.

The final candidate list is:

- **Chuck Payne** 
- **Ish Sookun** 
- **Jeff Mahoney** 
- **Rachel Schrader** 

### Key Dates

- **Jan. 19, 2025**: Voting opens 
- **Feb. 2, 2025**: Voting closes 
- **Feb. 3, 2025**: Results announced 

For more information about the candidates and the election, visit the [project mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/) where candidates are answering questions and informing members of their platform.

[Board members](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) serve as guides for the community, handle key project functions, facilitate initiatives, organize meetings, and manage openSUSE domains and trademarks. They also uphold community standards, including overseeing complaints and ensuring compliance with the openSUSE Code of Conduct.

Per the [Election Rules](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_rules), only current members are eligible to run for board positions. New members joining during the membership drive can participate in voting but cannot stand as candidates.

The election is overseen by committee members Edwin Zakaria, and Ariez Vachha. Their responsibilities include finalizing the candidate list and ensuring a smooth election process.
