# openSUSE.Asia Summit 2025, India  
## Logo Competition Announcement  

We are excited to announce the **openSUSE.Asia Summit 2025 Logo Competition**!  
A logo is more than just a designâ€”it represents the spirit, identity, and energy of the event. Every year, the summit logo reflects the unique, diverse, and dynamic communities of the host country.

This time, the **openSUSE.Asia Summit 2025** will be held in **Faridabad, India**, bringing together open-source enthusiasts, developers, and contributors from across Asia. We invite creative minds to design an outstanding logo for this year.

**The competition is now open!**  
As a token of appreciation, the winning design receives a **special prize** from the summit committee.
