This new era of tariffs and retaliatory measures may ripple through the tech sector and accelerate interest in open-source alternatives like [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/).

Businesses and governments globally are now considering their heavy dependence on proprietary software just as [Microsoft ends support for its Windows 10 operating system](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/11/26/transition-from-windows-step-by-step/).

These growing uncertainties are lending fresh momentum to the [Upgrade to Freedom](https://news.opensuse.org/category/upgrade-to-freedom) campaign, which is a grassroots initiative to encourage individuals and institutions to adopt open-source software. 

The timing could not be more critical.

Some, like geopolitical thinker [Fareed Zakaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fareed_Zakaria), believe the [digital cold war](https://hbr.org/2023/09/ai-and-the-new-digital-cold-war) will fracture
into rival political blocs, but open-source solutions offer clear alternatives. 

These alternatives are fully transparent, backed by global communities, and have proven themselves trustworthy for use in governments, institutions and enterprise environments.

Installing open-source solutions like [openSUSE’s](https://get.opensuse.org/) [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/), [Slowroll](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Slowroll), [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/), [Kalpa](https://kalpadesktop.org/), [Aeon](https://aeondesktop.org) or others gives users control of their infrastructure without licensing constraints, opaque code and geopolitical risk.

Open-source software belongs to everyone, and stands apart as being neutral, transparent and resilient by design.

This evolving trade dispute will have [financial implications.](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/03/21/choose-freedom-not-trailware/) stretching beyond software updates. If a digital services tax or stricter antitrust rules prevail in response to tariffs, access to cloud services, developer tools and even app stores could become more complicated or expensive for people. 

Analysts say these disputes jeopardize operations and sovereignty for those reliant on closed-source platforms. Migrations from Windows to Linux have never been more important.

The [European Commission sees open-source software](https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/digital-services/open-source-software-strategy_en) as more than an IT tool. Policy makers are encouraging open-source ecosystems to drive innovation, autonomy and collaboration in a world where global trade is being redrawn. 

This trade dispute highlights something most open-source advocates have known for years: open source is freedom. It’s freedom from monopolies, freedom from arbitrary pricing, and freedom from foreign influence.

Don’t buy new hardware just to keep up with software you no longer control. Reclaim your independence and build a future not dictated by trade wars or tech monopolies. Install [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/), reduce dependencies and protect your digital future.
