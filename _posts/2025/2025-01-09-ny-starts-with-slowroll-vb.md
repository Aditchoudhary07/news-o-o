The [openSUSE Slowroll](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Slowroll) community has welcomed the [January version bump](https://www.reddit.com/r/openSUSE_Slowroll/comments/1hwdxrx/january_version_bump/) that was completed recently.
 
Slowroll’s snapshots mark the beginning of fresh updates with the initial updates now accessible on mirrors globally.

This month’s bump comes a day early to avoid interruptions caused by routine maintenance on critical infrastructure. Updates are rolling out and users get new Tumbleweed versions from the [20250101 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/QXJW7JGTOO2QPCZM6OJAZB6R4H5PF45M/).

The updates integrate advancements from the [openSUSE reproducibility initiative](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/message/BKMFGPNWUCNLKZOWPA7GGKBERJBS4WN6/), which derive from [Factory/Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory). Key improvements include enhanced tools for reproducible builds and fixes for dependency handling, [parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing) and [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) in packages such as [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and others. 

Slowroll’s smart roll approach delivers a dependable foundation for users seeking a reliable system with essential security updates that avoid frequent changes seen in traditional rolling-release models. The balance makes it an excellent choice for those who want a balance of stability and access to modern software.

Updates for Slowroll arrive between an average of 5 to 10 days after being released in Tumbleweed. Users can read the latest [monthly update for Tumbleweed](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/01/08/tw-monthly-update-december/) to see what packages are arriving in Slowroll; recent updates include [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) 9.2.0, which adds 3D acceleration for Vulkan apps and enhanced crypto support, and [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) 2.5.2, which features ECC+Kyber key generation and improved smart card handling.

While still marked as experimental (for lack of automated tests), Slowroll continues to evolve and offers users a dependable and innovative alternative in the openSUSE ecosystem.
