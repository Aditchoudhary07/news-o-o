If you are planning to attend the [openSUSE Conference 2025](https://events.opensuse.org) 2025 from June 26 â€“ 28, there are important visa requirements you should be aware of.

If you are not a citizen of a Schengen country, you should check the visa requirements and exemptions for entry into Germany. Some participants may also need a formal invitation letter explaining the nature of the visit. An alphabetical list of countries requiring an invitation letter is available on the [Federal Foreign Office website](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/visa-service/). If you require such a letter, please email <ddemaio@opensuse.org> as soon as possible.

The Travel Support Program does not cover the cost of obtaining a visa. Attendees are responsible for any visa-related expenses.

The conference is scheduled to take place in Nuremberg, Germany.
