The promising new package management tool [Myrlyn](https://github.com/shundhammer/myrlyn) now includes a much-requested feature: repository configuration. Users can now easily [manage their repos](https://github.com/shundhammer/myrlyn/issues/69), adjust priorities, enable auto-refresh, and even add well-known community repositories like [pacman](https://software.opensuse.org/package/pacman), [openh264](https://software.opensuse.org/package/openh264), [libdvdcss](https://software.opensuse.org/package/libdvdcss), and [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com); all with Myrlyn’s streamlined UI!

**Key Features:**
  - View repo details, including priority, auto-refresh status, and URL.
  - Modify repo settings directly from the interface.
  - Add custom repos with libzypp variables like $releasever.
  - Select community repos automatically tailored for [Leap, Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/) or [Slowroll](https://de.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Slowroll).
  - Enable read-only mode for non-privileged users.
  
Some users have been exclusively managing their systems with Myrlyn, which showcases its reliability. Myrlyn was developed during Hack Week 24 and  is a standalone Qt-based package manager, free from YaST dependencies.
