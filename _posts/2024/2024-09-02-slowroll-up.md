As[Slowroll](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Slowroll) continues its journey, the latest updates released on [August 30](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/BQE4US3FPGEZKOJNEYBNMB2BW2QJCF2B/) and [Sept. 2](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/SH44ZK6FHLFMELMNV2XI377DAFRPRPNP/) have brought a slew of maintenance packages that enhance systems. These updates are part of Slowroll's ongoing effort to provide users with a balanced rolling release that prioritizes stability while keeping the software stack up-to-date.

[Updates for the quarter](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/07/03/slowroll-set-for-a-quarter-of-updates/) were scheduled for July 9, August 9 and Sept. 9, so the updates are well with the the monthly cadence.

[August 30](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/BQE4US3FPGEZKOJNEYBNMB2BW2QJCF2B/) updates had 49 packages that focused primarily on existing tools. Key updates include:

* Development Tools: Updates to llvm14, llvm15, and llvm17, alongside other essential packages like bash and python-Flask-Cors, ensure that developers working within the Slowroll environment have access to the latest tools and libraries for compiling and development.
* System Utilities: The update includes improvements to NetworkManager-branding and ddcutil-service, which contribute to system performance and hardware compatibility.
* Multimedia and Graphics: Applications like darktable, muPDF, and SDL_mixer received updates to provide smoother performance in graphic-related tasks.
* Virtualization: The inclusion of an update for VirtualBox ensures that users relying on virtual environments continue to have a stable and secure platform for running other operating systems or isolated environments.


[Sept. 2](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/SH44ZK6FHLFMELMNV2XI377DAFRPRPNP/) updates closely followed and delivered 44 packages. These updates include:
    
* Network and Security: Updates include those for NetworkManager, bind and dkimproxy for reliable network operations.
* Multimedia Improvements: The update provides enhancements to the gstreamer family of packages (gstreamer, gstreamer-plugins-bad, gstreamer-plugins-base, etc.) that are essential for media processing and playback. 
* System Utilities and Development: buildah, dracut and python-flake8 were among the tools updates for to both system administrators and developers.
* Virtualization and Cloud: Updates to nextcloud and python-azure-agent focused on Slowrollâ€™s cloud and virtual environments and technologies.

The development team is expected to release more updates in the future with a similar release cadence.

It's crucial to understand that Slowroll is not intended to replace [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/). Instead, it provides an alternative for users who desire more up-to-date software at a slower cadence than [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) but faster than Leap.

If you try Slowroll, have a lot of fun - rolling... slowly!
