**Episode 8: Testing and Breaking Builds - Offloading Repetitive Tasks to Computers, While You Have Fun Exploring**
 - Date: May 23

In the upcoming Episode 8, [openQA](http://open.qa/) engineer Santiago Zarate will do a live talk and explain how open-source contributors can maintain high standards of testing quality while reducing the manual workload.

These workshops offer a platform for learning and for contributors to ask questions and engage directly with developers, maintainers and experienced members of the openSUSE community.

These following episodes are tailored to provide an overview and practical advice for open-source software developments and contributions.
