Welcome to the monthly update for Tumbleweed for September 2024! This month, the rolling-release model has kept pace with numerous important updates and bug fixes. PostgreSQL received a major update moving to 17 and text shaping engine [harfbuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz) had a major update to version 10. Packages like [systemd](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/), [git](https://github.com/git), [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) were also updated this month in the rolling release. Various packages saw CVE fixes and desktop components for [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) and [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) were also updated. As always, remember to roll back using [snapper](https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper) if any issues arise. 

Happy updating and tumble on!

### New Features and Enhancements
* [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) 6.11.0: The latest update brings reversion of the PCI ACS configurability extension to address an issue [bsc#1229019](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1229019). Key updates in the release include a fix to the block subsystem, resolving how the scheduler is handled in `elv_iosched_local_module`. A correction was made in the [AMD](https://www.amd.com) GPU display driver to address a mistake from a previous revert related to [bsc#1228093](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1228093). Updates also include refreshed [ALSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture) patches to enhance power management blacklist options. The improvements are expected to provide greater stability and performance for various hardware configurations.
* [postgresql17](https://www.postgresql.org/): This major release provides key improvements like a revamped memory management system for vacuum, boosting efficiency by reducing memory usage by up to 20x along with optimized processing for high concurrency workloads. Version 17 also enhances query execution with faster processing using B-tree indexes and parallel BRIN index builds. Developers benefit from the addition of the SQL/JSON `JSON_TABLE` command and expanded MERGE capabilities, as well as a 2x speed improvement in data exports with the `COPY` command. Logical replication now simplifies major version upgrades by eliminating the need to drop replication slots, improving ease of use in high availability setups. The software package further enhances database security and operational management, with new TLS options, incremental backups, and detailed monitoring tools.
* [harfbuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz) 10.0.1: Significant fixes were made for the text shaping engine including support for Unicode 16.0.0. The version has a new [Application Programming Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) that allows clients to customize glyphs when a Unicode Variation Selector isn't supported by the font, as well as a callback for getting table tags from `hb_face_t`. Updates also address pair positioning lookup subtable application for compatibility and ensure subsetting fails if no glyphs are present to prevent silent errors.

[KWin](https://userbase.kde.org/KWin) addresses several crash scenarios, such as null dereference and input event handling from removed devices. [Plasma Desktop](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) includes fixes for keyboard navigation in Kickoff, task list alignment in RTL mode and it has proper handling of background icons and test windows. Plasma Workspace enhances touchscreen interaction, system tray tooltips and clipboard functionality. Additional fixes included targeted crashes in hotplugging and svg rendering, while SDDM KCM improves state management. 
* [Frameworks 6.6.0](https://kde.org/announcements/frameworks/6/6.6.0/): [Attica](https://api.kde.org/frameworks/attica/html/index.html) adds CI jobs for Alpine/musl, while [Baloo](https://community.kde.org/Baloo) sets up crash handling for baloo_file.

[Akonadi resolves](https://invent.kde.org/pim/akonadi) a crash related to query cache eviction and fixes configuration file handling. [Dolphin](https://apps.kde.org/dolphin/) improves usability with fixes for button functionality and file list resizing, while [Elisa](https://apps.kde.org/elisa/) enhances its Now Playing view and toolbar layout. [Itinerary](https://apps.kde.org/itinerary/) and [Kalarm](https://apps.kde.org/de/kalarm/) both receive updates for better dark mode handling and audio alarm functionality. [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) addresses multiple timeline and rendering issues, optimized keyframe handling and fixes several bugs related to effects and transitions.
