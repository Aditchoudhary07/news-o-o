Python 3.13 RC2 is now available in [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/). This new version of
the [Python](https://www.python.org/) interpreter will be released in October 2024.

There is [a lot of changes](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130rc2/) and new features in 3.13, but we're also bringing exiting experimental features in Tumbleweed.

### Experimental JIT compiler

The default (`python313`) build has the flag `--enable-experimental-jit=yes-off`. This means that if you want to use this [experimental JIT](https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#an-experimental-just-in-time-jit-compiler) you can enable with an environment variable:

```
$ PYTHON_JIT=1 python313
```

You can find more information about the JIT compiler and how it can improve performance in
[PEP-744](https://peps.python.org/pep-0744/).

### Free threaded CPython (no GIL)

With this new version of Python interpreter, there is an option to build without the famous [Global Interpreter Lock](https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#free-threaded-cpython), aka GIL. This is a really experimental feature, but why not have this on Tumbleweed? So we decided to build also this new version with a new package `python313-nogil`.

This new package is an isolated interpreter, so you can install without conflicts with `python313`. The package is building with the `--disable-gil` option and it provides the `/usr/bin/python3.13t` binary. It uses by default `/usr/lib/python3.13t/site-packages` for third-party libs so, with the default configuration, it won't use any
python 3.13 module.

This means that now you can use `threading.Thread` in the Python interpreter, and it will be actual threads so, at the end using threads with `python3.13t`, interpreter should be a lot faster.

There's no packages for this interpreter in Tumbleweed, at this moment. So if you want to use third party libraries you should use `virtualenv` and `pip` for that:

```
$ python3.13t -m venv free-threaded-env
$ source free-threaded-env/bin/activate
(free-threaded-env) $ pip install requests
(free-threaded-env) $ python3
Python 3.13.0rc2 experimental free-threading build (main, Sep 07 2024, 16:06:06) [GCC] on linux
