Users of [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) can now rely on the built-in `switcherooctl` tool for GPU switching, which is already integrated into our distributions with major desktop environments like [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) and [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/).

This is a game changer because it eliminates the need for additional tools and simplifies multi-GPU management while enhancing compatibility and performance with users’ systems.

For years, tools such as [`suse-prime`](https://github.com/openSUSE/SUSEPrime) and [`bbswitch`](https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bbswitch) have been staples in managing [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) Optimus laptops and multi-GPU systems, but advancements in kernel drivers and desktop environments have made these tools unnecessary in most cases. 

Installations of openSUSE now handle these configurations out of the box, whether using the open-source [Nouveau](https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/) driver or [NVIDIA’s](https://www.nvidia.com/) proprietary drivers.

In a [recent update on multi-GPU systems](https://negativo17.org/prime-optimus-laptops-and-multi-gpu-systems/), users are encouraged to move away from legacy tools like `suse-prime`, `bbswitch`, and [`bumblebee`](https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/), as they can cause more harm than good on modern systems. 

The recommended solution is `switcherooctl`, which is a lightweight userspace utility designed to manage GPU switching on systems with multiple GPUs. It integrates well with [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) and [Xorg](https://www.x.org); its functionality extends across both [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) + NVIDIA and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/) + NVIDIA setups. By using `switcherooctl`, users can easily select which GPU to use for specific applications and eliminate the need for complex scripts or environment variables.

### Benefits of `switcherooctl`
- **Seamless Integration**: Unlike older tools, `switcherooctl` is designed to work natively with modern Linux systems and desktop environments. This ensures a smoother user experience without requiring complex configurations.

- **Improved Performance**: Users can specify which GPU to use for specific tasks, so `switcherooctl` enables optimal performance. Compute-heavy applications, such as gaming or 3D rendering, can utilize the discrete GPU, while less intensive tasks default to the integrated GPU to save power.

- **Enhanced Power Management**: Switching back to the integrated GPU when the discrete GPU is not needed conserves battery life and makes it ideal for laptops and portable systems.

- **Wayland and Xorg Compatibility**: With increasing adoption of Wayland, having a tool that supports both Wayland and Xorg ensures compatibility across a broad range of systems and setups.

- **Cross-Vendor Support**: The Intel + NVIDIA or AMD + NVIDIA configuration make the systems more versatile for all users.

Users should being embracing `switcherooctl` for multi-GPU management as some of the older tools like  `suse-prime`, `bbswitch` and `bumblebee` are likely to be phased out.
