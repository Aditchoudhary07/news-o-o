The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) community is preparing for the [Early Adopter Tech Summit](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/EATS25) on March 14 and 15, 2025, in Orlando, Florida. 

This event will take place at Loews Sapphire Falls Resort at Universal Orlando Resort and will take place as [SUSECON](https://www.suse.com/susecon/event-details/) concludes.

Partners of SUSE, openSUSE, open-source community projects and community members are all encouraged to register for the summit and [submit a talk](https://events.opensuse.org/). There are two types of talks available:

- **Short Talk**: 15 minutes
- **Standard Talk**: 30 minutes

The call for papers is open until January 15, 2025.

We welcome submissions from anyone passionate about open-source software and community development.

The summit's schedule will be published in February 2025. Visit [events.opensuse.org](https://events.opensuse.org/) for more information.
