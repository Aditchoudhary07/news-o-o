A recent back-and-forth on Windows 11’s hardware requirements and the end-of-life timeline for Windows 10 leaves millions of users frustrated and uncertain about their next steps.

With millions of PCs being labeled by [mainstream media as becoming obsolete](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/11/01/warning-for-14-billion-microsoft-windows-10-windows-11-users-get-free-upgrade/) and potential extended security updates costing users even more, the need for a reliable and sustainable alternative has never been greater.

Linux distributions like [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) offer a clear and practical solution. It eliminates the risks of vendor lock-in and avoids the pitfalls of Microsoft’s opaque and ever-changing policies.

The recent uncertainty around Microsoft’s policies underscores the challenges of depending on a company that prioritizes profits over a user's fundamental needs, which is the ability to use their existing hardware and software effectively.

Microsoft initially doubled down on strict hardware requirements for Windows 11, requiring [Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module). In a surprising reversal, the company issued instructions for installing Windows 11 on incompatible PCs, which can leave users even more confused.

This apparent change now is undermined by caveats like updates may not be available for unsupported PCs, and the company has openly warned that such installations could lead to system malfunctions. For many, the message is clear; Upgrade to Freedom! Upgrade to [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/)!

Microsoft deserves some credit for extending some support, avoiding responsibility for one of the largest preventable e-waste surges in history caused by a software upgrade. However, these efforts do little to address the broader challenges impacting millions of users and the wider consequences for consumers and the environment.

The case for Linux and openSUSE is clear. Linux provides viable, cost-effective and sustainable alternatives. Users can enjoy a free, open-source operating system that doesn’t require costly upgrades or restrictive hardware requirements with installing openSUSE. Here are a few things users that want to transition can consider:

- **Complete Transparency:** Linux distributions like openSUSE are governed by open-source principles, ensuring clear and consistent development.
- **No Forced Obsolescence:** openSUSE supports a wide range of hardware like modern machines to older PCs that allow users to extend the life of their devices.
- **Cost Savings:** openSUSE is free to use, with no licensing fees or hidden subscription costs for extended support.

By switching to Linux, users can help combat e-waste as every PC saved from a landfill is a win for the environment.

Transitioning to Linux is easier than people think and openSUSE is one of the most user-friendly distributions that provides comprehensive tools for installation and configuration.

- **Back Up Your Data:** Safeguard important files before transitioning.
- **Download openSUSE:** Visit [get.opensuse.org](https://get.opensuse.org/) to choose between [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) (stable, less updates) or [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed) (rolling updates, several).
- **Install openSUSE:** Create a [bootable USB](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Create_a_Live_USB_stick_using_Windows#Using_Etcher) and follow the guided installation process.
- **Explore Applications:** Discover [free alternatives to popular software](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/12/03/opensuse-empowers-pros/), such as LibreOffice for productivity, GIMP for image editing, and Steam for gaming.

Take control of your tech future and embrace the ability to Upgrade to Freedome with openSUSE. Your next step is just a click away - [get.opensuse.org](https://get.opensuse.org/).
