The openSUSE Board is calling for the formation of a working group to explore topics focused on project governance, operational models and rebranding for the project. 

This follows a call on the [openSUSE Project mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/3PSZOWYRYAGCDUXIW5EK4RP2CO3PA647/) to formalize efforts, ideas and suggestions by community members in a [centralized location](https://forums.opensuse.org/c/special-discussions/project-discussions).

The openSUSE Board emphasizes its role as a facilitator rather than the sole driver as community participation should shape the project. 

“The strength of open-source projects like openSUSE comes from the community,” was posted in [an email to the openSUSE Project mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/3PSZOWYRYAGCDUXIW5EK4RP2CO3PA647/). 

Objectives of the Work Group:
- **Exploring Models for Project Governance**
- **Examining Operational Improvements**
- **Determining Resources for Effective Project Rebranding**

The work group will concentrate community discussions and propose actionable options within 90 days; this will provide opportunities for the wider community to weigh in on the items proposed. Key governance documents, such as the current [Board guidelines](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) and [election rules](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_rules), should be reviewed to assess potential updates.

Discussions will be organized centrally in a separate section of the [openSUSE forums](https://forums.opensuse.org/c/special-discussions/project-discussions) to foster constructive debate and minimize off-topic discussions. This forum will be heavily moderated. openSUSE community members interested in participating can [request access](https://forums.opensuse.org/c/special-discussions/project-discussions) to the forum; the discussions will be publicly viewable.
