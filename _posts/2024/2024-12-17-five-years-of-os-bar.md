The openSUSE community will celebrate the 5-year anniversary of the [openSUSE Bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) on Dec. 19. Join people in the bar and celebrate this social space where open-source enthusiasts, developers and like minded individuals can come together to discuss open source and other topics.

The [bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) has become more than just a meeting place; it is a space to collaborate, connect and a welcoming atmosphere for sharing ideas. For years, the space has had countless informal meetups and networking events, celebratory moments after openSUSE milestones and is a place for openSUSE fans to gather.

People are invited to join in the celebration and to share memories or stories of their experience in the openSUSE Bar. 

You can find a [video about the beginning of the openSUSE Bar](https://youtu.be/YmnawYltDSQ?si=mjH9oJGM3wxgnUfq) from a talk at [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/) 2022.
