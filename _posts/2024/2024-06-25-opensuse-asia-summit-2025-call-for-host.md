The openSUSE.Asia Summit is an annual openSUSE conference in Asia and a great opportunity for contributors and enthusiasts from Asia to come together and meet face-to-face. The event focuses primarily on the openSUSE distribution, its applications for personal and enterprise use, and open source culture.  

In its quest to spread openSUSE throughout Asia, [openSUSE.Asia Summit Organization Committee](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Asia_Organization_Committee) seeks out local communities to rise to the challenge of organizing an excellent openSUSE event in 2025. The committee stands ready to assist you throughout the process.

Here is the date you need to take notes:

  * Oct. 1: Deadline for application
  * Nov. 3: Presentation at openSUSE.Asia Summit 2024
  * Dec. 23: Announcement of the following host

We will invite you to our regular online meetings so that you can experience and learn how to organize the event. Furthermore, we will ask you to present your proposals at the next summit in Tokyo, Japan.

The submitted proposals are to be reviewed by the organization committee. During the review, the committee might have additional questions and requests.

### How to Submit?

Please email your proposal to both [summit@lists.opensuse.org](summit@lists.opensuse.org) and [opensuseasia-summit@googlegroups.com](opensuseasia-summit@googlegroups.com). Because the former address does not allow attachments, you need to upload your proposal somewhere and share the link to it.

The proposal should contain:

  * Venue
  * How to reach your city and venue
  * Budget Estimation
    * Conference Venue
    * T-shirt
    * Tea break, Lunch, Dinner, Conference Tour, etc.
  * Introduction to your community who will organize the summit

Please refer to [openSUSE.Asia Summit Tips for Organizers](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Asia_Summit_Tips_for_Organizers) before writing your proposal.

We are looking forward to hearing from you soon!
