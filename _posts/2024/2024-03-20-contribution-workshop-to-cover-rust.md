The [openSUSE](https://www.get.opensuse.org/) community's [Contribution Workshops](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/02/14/contribution-sessions-begin-tomorrow/) continues to move forward with exciting new sessions. 

The next session, which is Episode 4: openSUSE Contribution Workshop: Packaging Rust in [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/), is scheduled to take place tomorrow, March 21 at 20:15 UTC on the [openSUSE Projectâ€™s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/opensuse). The stream will coincide with the [community meeting](https://calendar.opensuse.org/teams/marketing/events/thursday_weekly_meeting) and provide an option for live interaction and learning. This session promises to delve on the intricacies of packaging Rust projects in [OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/).

Episode 5 will focus on contributing to [openSUSE Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/) and will likely be released next week. The session aims to shed light on the internal workings of the openSUSE Leap distribution and offers insights into project structure, feature tracking and the process of updating packages sourced from [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server](https://www.suse.com/products/server/). The schedule for this episode will be announced on [calendar.opensuse.org](https://calendar.opensuse.org/).

The  [Contribution Workshops](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/02/14/contribution-sessions-begin-tomorrow/) series was launched in February and the workshops aim to equip enthusiasts and newcomers with the necessary skills to contribute effectively to the project.
