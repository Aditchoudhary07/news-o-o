The votes are in, and the openSUSE Asia Summit Organization Committee is pleased to announce the winner of the [openSUSE.Asia Summit 2024](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSAS24/) [logo competition](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/05/22/openSUSE-Asia-2024-CFL//).

The openSUSE Asia Summit Organization Committee would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude for your invaluable contribution to the openSUSE.Asia Summit 2024 Logo Competition.

Choosing this year's logo was tough because every submitted work was excellent, and the top three received equal votes.

We have finally decided to select Bayu Aji's work from Indonesia as the logo of openSUSE.Asia Summit 2024.

Congratulations, Bayu! The winner will receive a special "Geeko Mystery Box".

This year's competition attracted 7 fantastic submissions from around the globe. The designs were all exceptional, and the votes were cast by the openSUSE.Asia Committee and Local Team. We sincerely thank everyone who participated in the voting process.

We would also like to express our appreciation to all the participants in the logo competition: Haruo Yoshino, Goofy Scalar, Kukuh Syafaat, Nikita Tripathi, and Daniel Galleguillos Cruz. We look forward to seeing you at the Summit!
