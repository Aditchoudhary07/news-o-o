The openSUSE.Asia Summit 2024 is fast approaching, and we're excited to [invite participants](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/05/31/os-asia-summit-invitation/) from all over the world to join us Nov. 2 and 3 in Tokyo, Japan. 

This year promises a diverse range of sessions and activities, with an inclusive Cross-Distro Track featuring collaborations with community members from AlmaLinux, Debian and Ubuntu .

Those who want to provide a talk need to [submit either long talk or short talk presentations](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/06/04/os-asia-summit-call-for-speakers/) by August 4. Those speakers needing financial assistance can use the [Travel Support Program (TSP)](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program), which is aided through donations to the [Geeko Foundation](https://geekos.org/). The TSP helps covering travel expenses. Here’s a detailed look at important deadlines for TSP applications and speaker proposals to ensure you don’t miss out on this incredible opportunity.

### Travel Support Program (TSP) Schedule
The Travel Support Program is designed to help you join us at the summit. Here’s the timeline you need to follow:

- TSP Application Open: As soon as possible. Don't wait to apply for travel support. 
- Call for Speakers Deadline: August 4. If you’re interested in sharing your knowledge and experience, submit your proposal by this date.
- TSP Application Deadline: August 20. Ensure your application for travel support is completed and submitted by this date. Visit the [wiki for more information](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program)
- Call for Speakers Notification: Speakers will be notified if their proposal has been accepted toward the end of August.
- TSP Confirmation: Final confirmation of travel support will follow shortly after the speakers' notifications. Around August 26. 

### Submitting Your Proposal
The openSUSE.Asia committee is looking for speakers who can bring diverse perspectives and insights related to openSUSE and other Linux distributions. Here are some guidelines and tips to help you submit a strong proposal:

- Non-Technical Topics: Overviews of Open Source technologies, community management, education, and personal experience stories are also welcome.
- Session Types: You can propose long talks (30 minutes plus Q&A) or short talks (15 minutes plus Q&A). Lighting talk sessions will be announced later.

How to Submit: Proposals should be submitted through [events.opensuse.org](https://events.opensuse.org/). Make sure your submission is in English, is between 130 to 250 words, and adheres to the openSUSE Conference Code of Conduct.
