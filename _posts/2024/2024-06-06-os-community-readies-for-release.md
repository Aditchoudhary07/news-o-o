Members of [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) are excited about the launch of [Leap 15.6](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/15.6/) on June 12 and encourages people to host a Release Party.

If you don’t know how to do this, there is a list of [steps below on how to have a successful release party](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_party_HOWTO). 

If you’re interested in hosting your own Release Party, there’s a handy checklist to help you plan a successful event:
- Find a Date: A weekend date is usually best, but flexibility is key. Find a common date that works for most people.
- Find a Place: A café, bar, or Linux group meetup location works great. Whether you opt for a coffee and cake party or a beer and pizza gathering, the key is to have fun.
- Cake: While not essential, a cake adds to the celebration. You can also bake openSUSE cookies. 
- Pictures: Capture the moment with photos or videos and share them on social media. Tag openSUSE on [X](https://x.com/openSUSE), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/en.openSUSE), [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@opensuse), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/opensuse.bsky.social) or more.

There is already a plan to have peoole to meet virtually in the [openSUSE Bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) for the launch June 12. The virtual release party will feature members of the release team and community members. Join sometime on June 12 as participants from various countries are encouraged to join and interact with the openSUSE community.

Some will celebration the event in Nuremberg. Certainly people at the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/) will highlight the release during the [BBQ/Release Party](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24/program/proposals/4697).

These launch parties provide a chance for the community to connect with the people behind the project and to show an appreciation for contributors who make the release of Leap 15.6 possible. It's an excellent opportunity for the community to gather, celebrate and discuss the new release after months of development.

Schedule your [release party](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties) today on the wiki and have a lot of fun!
