Release Candidate images of Leap Micro 6.1 can be found at [get.opensuse.org](https://get.opensuse.org/leapmicro/6.1/).

At this point we're only awaiting confirmation of the Leap Micro 6.1 maintenance setup prior making an official release; hopefully coming later this week.

**Please be aware that the release of Leap Micro 6.1 means the end of life for Leap Micro 5.5.** 

Users are advised to upgrade to either Leap Micro 6.0 or 6.1 and can find details about release cycle on the [openSUSE wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Leap_Micro).

Users upgrading from previous releases can consider our experimental [opensuse-migration-tool](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/11/29/try-opensuse-migration-tool-leap-micro-61-beta/).
The migration tool will be part of Leap Micro 6.1+; users from older release can still get the [tool from git](https://github.com/openSUSE/opensuse-migration-tool).

See our [Leap Micro upgrade wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:System_upgrade_of_LeapMicro) for more information about upgrade options.

See [SLE Micro 6.1 Release notes](https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/x86_64/SL-Micro/6.1/index.html) and a summary for a list of changes in the [Leap Micro 6.1 Alpha announcement](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/11/20/leap-micro-61-alpha-availability/).
