At this point we're only awaiting confirmation of the Leap Micro 6.1 maintenance setup prior making an official release hopefully later this week.

**Please be aware that release of Leap Micro 6.1 means end of life for Leap Micro 5.5.**
Users are advised to upgrade to either Leap Micro 6.0 or 6.1.

Users upgrading from previous releases can consider our experimental [opensuse-migration-tool](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/11/29/try-opensuse-migration-tool-leap-micro-61-beta/).
Migration tool it will be part of Leap Micro 6.1+, users from older release can still get the tool from git.
