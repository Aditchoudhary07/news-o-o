The release of [Leap 15.6 on June 12](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/06/12/leap-unveils-choices-for-users/) set in motion the End of Life for maintenance and security for [Leap 15.5](https://news.opensuse.org/2023/06/07/leap-release-matures-sets-up-tech-transition/), which will happen at the end of December.

Users should upgrade to openSUSE Leap 15.6 to continue to receive security and maintenance updates. Leap versions have a six-month end-of-life period after the release of a new version.
