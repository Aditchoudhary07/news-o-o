Open-source software developers, tech enthusiasts and innovators worldwide are set for [Hack Week 24](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) that starts today and runs through Nov. 22. 

The event is a cornerstone of fostering creativity and collaboration and invites participants to [explore personal and community-driven projects](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/24/projects/popular?page_size=10). 

Hack Week provides a unique opportunity for developers to step away from their usual tasks and dive into passion projects, learning new skills and forge new connections.

This year's theme is “Train of Thought” and draws inspiration from the idea that seemingly unrelated ideas can connect to spark innovative breakthroughs.

Here are some Hack Week 24 projects that are garnering attention. 
- [New openSUSE-welcome](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/24/projects/opensuse-welcome): This project aims to revamp the openSUSE Welcome app to enhance the first-time user experience. Key goals include integrating end-of-life (EOL) notifications for openSUSE Leap, addressing potential upgrade notifications and ensuring the application is rebranded and maintained. The updated application will be submitted to openSUSE Factory and Leap 16.0, with corresponding updates to openQA testing.
- [Port Classic Games to Linux](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/24/projects/port-some-classic-game-to-linux): Revive 1990s-era games by reverse-engineering their data and creating open-source engines.
- [Cluster API Provider for Harvester](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/24/projects/cluster-api-provider-for-harvester): This project builds on progress made in Hack Week 23 to create an infrastructure provider for Harvester using Cluster API (CAPI). Enhancements for 2024 include adding support for ClusterClass, improved CI and end-to-end testing. Developers are also exploring packaging templates as Helm Charts and testing with newer Harvester versions. The project encourages collaboration from those familiar with CAPI, Harvester, and related technologies.
- [openSUSE on LoongArch](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/24/projects/bootstrap-opensuse-on-loongarch): Targeting a new architecture from China, this project focuses on building openSUSE support for LoongArch, which has already seen adoption in Debian Ports and Gentoo. The initial goal is to integrate LoongArch into OBS (Open Build Service) and build a minimal set of packages.

Other projects range from deep learning integration to creating openSUSE images for emerging architectures like Arm and RISC-V. Participants can also join efforts to modernize system tools or explore creative avenues like applying AI to board games or designing user-friendly command-line tools.

Hack Week thrives on collaboration and participants are encouraged to join discussions through platforms like the [Uyuni Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/uyuni-project/hackweek) or work on group projects. 

Whether you're an experienced coder or a curious learner, Hack Week 24 offers a welcoming environment to push the boundaries of open-source innovation.
