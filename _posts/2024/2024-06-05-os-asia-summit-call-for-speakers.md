We are pleased to announce that the call for speakers for openSUSE.Asia Summit 2024 started today. The event will be held on November 2 and 3 in Tokyo, Japan. Please check [our announcement](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/05/31/os-asia-summit-invitation/) for more details of the event.

The openSUSE.Asia committee members are looking for the speakers who share their knowledge or experiences related to openSUSE from different avenues of life. The speakers are able to receive sponsorship from [the openSUSE Travel Support Program (TSP)](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program). It is a good opportunity for you to consider applying for the proposal and participating even if you are far from Japan.

In this year, we will invite Cross-Distro Track in collaboration with other distribution communities like AlmaLinux, Debian, and Ubuntu; we will welcome talks related to those distributions.


### Topics

The examples of the topics (not limited to) are as the following:

* openSUSE (e.g., Leap, Tumbleweed, Micro OS, Open Build Services, openQA, YaST)
* Desktop environments and applications (e.g., GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
* Office suite, graphic art, multimedia (e.g., LibreOffice, Calligra, GIMP, Inkscape)

* Cloud, Virtualization, Container, and Container Orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Rancher)
* Package supply-chain security, vulnerability management
