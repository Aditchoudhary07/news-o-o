[Slowroll](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Slowroll), which has a more modest update cadence than [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/), is gaining acceptance as a balance between the rapid updates of Tumbleweed's rolling releases and the traditional [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) release.

Slowroll is nearly ready for full deployment and the development team has been working diligently to prepare the next version bump, with planned updates scheduled for July 9, August 9 and Sept. 9. These updates are expected to maintain a consistent monthly cadence to ensure users have timely and stable updates.

One of the critical updates pulled in will include the latest [OpenSSH](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable) CVE fixes, which have already been made available in Tumbleweed. This fix enhances the security of Slowroll & ensure that it remains a robust and reliable distribution for users.

### Highlighted Features of Slowroll
Balanced Update Cadence: Slowroll offers a monthly rolling update cycle that provides users with the latest features and security updates while ensuring stability through extensive testing and validation.

Beta Phase: Slowroll is now in the Beta phase, indicating its near readiness for full deployment. Users can expect a reliable experience with continuous improvements.

Continuous Improvement: The distribution integrates big updates approximately every month, alongside continuous bug fixes and security patches, ensuring a secure and up-to-date system.

### Statistics and Status
According to the latest statistics available on the [Slowroll Stats page](http://stage3.opensuse.org:17080/munin/opensuse.org/stage3.opensuse.org/slowrollstats.html):
- Tumbleweed had 2813 updated packages since the last version bump
- Slowroll received 1316 updates from 871 different packages and only 339 updated rpms are Slowroll-specific builds

### Origins and Purpose
Slowroll, introduced in 2023, was designed as an experimental distribution. Its primary goal is to offer a slower rolling release compared to Tumbleweed, thus enhancing stability without compromising on access to new features. The distribution continuously evolves with big updates integrated approximately every month, supported by regular bug fixes and security updates.

It's crucial to understand that Slowroll is not intended to replace Leap. Instead, it provides an alternative for users who desire more up-to-date software at a slower pace than Tumbleweed but faster than Leap.

If you try Slowroll, have a lot of fun - rolling... slowly!
