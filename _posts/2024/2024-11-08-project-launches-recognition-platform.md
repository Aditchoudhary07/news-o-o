The [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) has announced the launch of a new initiative aimed at [highlighting contributions of its diverse community members](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/2Q4D5ERCHY7MBA6GHZ2K4SC7BFK5FEML/). 

Dubbed "Contributor in the Spotlight," the project aims to feature a different contributor each month and showcase their work in areas such as coding, art, documentation and more.

“It’s a great opportunity to get involved in the community and help ensure that our contributors receive the recognition they deserve,” wrote Tobias Görgens and Gertjan Lettink in an [email on the project mailing list](add link to email here).

The program aims to increase visibility, provide recognition, express gratitude and to inspire others to contribute to open-source.

Many contributors’ efforts often go unnoticed and this initiative seeks to change this by sharing their stories and acknowledging their efforts to enhance open source development.

Contributors can apply to be featured by self-nomination though submitting an application by the 15th of each month.  Nominations are permissible with the consent of the person being nominated. The selection process will focus on impact, uniqueness and relevance of their work to the project and beyond. Those chosen will be spotlighted in a blog post on the first Monday of the following month.

In addition to encouraging submissions, members of the project seek volunteers to help manage the initiative. Organizers will review applications, create blog posts and promote the project within the community.

Applications are now open, with the first feature expected to be published soon.

For more information, visit the mailing list email or the [openSUSE GitHub page](https://github.com/openSUSE/cits/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=application-contributor).
