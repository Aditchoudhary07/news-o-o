Welcome to the monthly update for openSUSE Tumbleweed for March 2024. This month provided several anticipated updates for the rolling release. 

Before getting in the package updates, know that this blog aims to provide readers an overview of the key changes, improvements and issues addressed in openSUSE rolling release throughout the month. Should readers desire a more frequent amount of information about snapshot updates, readers are encouraged to subscribe to the [openSUSE Factory mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/).

Letâ€™s get started.

### New Features and Enhancements
* [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/): Versions for the month of March progressed update version 6.8.1. These updates enhance system stability, security and hardware compatibility. Snapshot [20240319](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/EW5VWYR22A4A5772WTYLPGXTFVGJTZKK/) that moved the kernel from 6.7.9 to 6.8.1 did the following:
  * Patches addressed [Register File Data Sampling (RFDS)](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/hw-vuln/reg-file-data-sampling.html) microarchitectural vulnerabilities [CVE-2023-28746](https://www.suse.com/de-de/security/cve/CVE-2023-28746.html). The patch includes mitigation measures such as exporting to guests in KVM/x86 environments and adds new documentation. There was a patch to disable [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page)  mitigation when the `X86_FEATURE_CLEAR_CPU_BUF` is set.
  * A notable reversion is the removal of code for `inode_cache` and `recovery` mount options from [Btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org), following [an issue](https://github.com/yast/yast-update/issues/197). Fixes related to Btrfs, such as addressing a race condition when detecting [Delayed Allocation](https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/DelayedAllocation) ranges during [fiemap](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/fiemap.txt).
  * The updates involve significant configuration changes for [arm](https://www.arm.com/) architectures (armv6hl, armv7hl, and arm64). The updates mirror option values across different architectures and include new configurations for hardware support, such as various PINCTRL (Pin Control), GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output), VIDEO, DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) and SND_SOC (Sound System on Chip) settings.
* [Plasma 6](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/03/22/plasma-arrives-in-os-distributions/): Find the article on [news.opensuse.org](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/03/22/plasma-arrives-in-os-distributions/)
* [GNOME 46](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/03/25/gnome-arrives-in-os-distributions/): Find the article on [news.opensuse.org](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/03/25/gnome-arrives-in-os-distributions/)
* [systemd](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/): From version 254.9 to 255.4, the updated provided the following:
  * Specific issues have been either rebased or removed if they've become part of the core version 255 updates. This indicates a significant step towards maintaining consistency with upstream developments while also ensuring the stability and reliability of systemd functionalities within penSUSE.
 * A clear emphasis has been placed on enhancing the testing framework within the systemd package to ensure the reliability of bootloader installation processes during testing phases. Read more info about the [systemd-bootl](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/03/05/systemd-boot-integration-in-os/) integration.
* [libzypp](https://github.com/openSUSE/libzypp) 17.32.0
  * Introduction of a new resolver option 'removeOrphaned' for dist-upgrade processes to enhance package management
  * Fixes applied to `vsftpd.conf` addressing issues where SUSE and Fedora use different defaults.
  * Security Updates: Modification to avoid using the deprecated OPENSSL_config in the Digest section, enhancing security practices.
  * Introduction of ProblemSolution::skipsPatchesOnly overload to improve patch management processes.
  * Removal of HTTPS->HTTP redirection exceptions for download.opensuse.org, reinforcing security and integrity in download processes.
* [zypper](https://github.com/openSUSE/zypper) 1.14.70: 
  * Integration of a new option `--remove-orphaned` to remove all orphaned packages during a system upgrade.
  * Improved user interface indicating active dry-run/download-only options at the commit prompt, enhancing user experience and clarity.
  * Setting of libzypp shutdown request signal upon `Ctrl+C` to improve responsiveness and control.
* [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) 18:
  * The patches `llvm-do-not-install-static-libraries.patch` and `llvm-normally-versioned-libllvm.patch` have been rebased to align with the new version, addressing specific distribution and library concerns.
  * Modification to prefer `ld.bfd` over other linkers to achieve a Transparent Huge Pages (THP)-compatible section layout, optimizing memory management and performance.
* [shadow](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/): Updates to version 4.15.1
  * Resolved an issue causing unwarranted error messages about unknown login.defs configuration options and implements checks for file descriptor omission to improve security and reliability
  * The `shadow-4.15.0-fix-definition.patch` has been updated to address the erroneous error messages regarding configuration options,
  * Improved linking with libdl for better dynamic library handling.
    * Revised the `shadow-login_defs-unused-by-pam.patch` to ensure continued compatibility and effectiveness.

### Bug Fixes
