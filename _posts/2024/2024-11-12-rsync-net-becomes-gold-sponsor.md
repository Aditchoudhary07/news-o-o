The [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) is excited to announce [rsync.net](https://www.rsync.net/) as the latest Gold Sponsor! 

The company’s support will empower the openSUSE community to continue building open-source solutions that serve users worldwide.

Rsync.net’s secure cloud storage and data backup solutions can assist openSUSE members with projects and package development. This is an excellent solution for securing offsite backups of critical data for a system. The cloud storage company [rsync.net](https://www.rsync.net/) dedicates resources not only to the openSUSE Project, but to other open-source projects like [Debian](https://www.rsync.net/debian.html) developers.  

Through this partnership, openSUSE community members with an openSUSE email address can access **500 GB of free-forever storage**. Members can also gain the additional benefits from rsync.net with affordable options for those who need even more space:

- **Standard Single Region:** $0.008 per GB per month, ensuring 99.9999% resiliency.
- **Geo-Redundant Storage:** $0.014 per GB per month, with automatic replication across regions for enhanced security.

Storage locations in **Silicon Valley**, **Denver**, **Zurich**, and **Hong Kong** can help to best suit developer needs. 

The openSUSE Project values this partnership with rsync.net and its members appreciate the company’s commitment to support our community and open-source efforts.
